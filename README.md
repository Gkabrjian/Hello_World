# Hello_World
the beginning of my journey in data science and programming
I come from a background in business and economics. I've been working in both for-profit and not-for-profit domains. but I realized that I want and need to change my career path, it's late, but not too late. now I'm aspiring to become a data scientist. this is me briefly.
